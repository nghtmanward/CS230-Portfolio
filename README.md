# CS 230 Portfolio – The Gaming Room Software Design

This repository contains my portfolio submission for CS 230: Operating Platforms.  
It includes the completed Software Design Document for *The Gaming Room* and my Module Eight journal reflection.

Repository Contents
• 	SoftwareDesignDocument.docx – Final software design document created for The Gaming Room client
• 	README.md – Project summary and Module Eight journal reflection

Project Summary
Draw It or Lose It is a multi‑platform, web‑based game developed for The Gaming Room. The client needed a scalable, secure, and platform‑independent architecture capable of supporting unique game instances, team management, and simultaneous users across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
My role in this project was to analyze the client’s requirements, evaluate operating platforms, and produce a complete software design document outlining architecture, constraints, and recommendations. The document demonstrates my ability to translate user needs into technical specifications and communicate effectively with both technical and non‑technical stakeholders.

Skills Demonstrated
• 	Requirements gathering and interpretation
• 	Software architecture and design planning
• 	Cross‑platform evaluation (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
• 	UML and structured design documentation
• 	Client‑focused technical communication
• 	Scalability, security, and resource‑management considerations
• 	Professional documentation and organization

Module Eight Journal Reflection
The Gaming Room is a client developing Draw It or Lose It, a web‑based, multi‑platform game that requires unique game instances, team management, and cross‑platform compatibility. Their goal was to expand their existing concept into a scalable and secure application accessible from Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
In my software design document, I translated the client’s requirements into clear technical and business constraints, communicating the architecture in a way that both developers and non‑technical stakeholders could understand. One of my strengths in this project was organizing the document so that each section built logically on the last, making the overall design easy to follow.
Working through the design document before coding was extremely helpful. It allowed me to think through the system architecture, constraints, and user needs early, which made the development process more efficient and reduced uncertainty. If I were to revise one part of the document, I would expand the Evaluation section with more detail about operating system differences and deployment considerations.
Interpreting the user’s needs was central to the design. The client required scalability, platform independence, and a smooth user experience, so I focused on a web‑based architecture and strict enforcement of unique identifiers for games and teams. Considering user needs is essential because software must solve real problems and provide value to the people who use it.
My approach to software design involved analyzing requirements, identifying constraints, and structuring the system into clear components. In future projects, I would continue using structured design documents, UML diagrams, and early architectural planning to ensure clarity and maintainability.
